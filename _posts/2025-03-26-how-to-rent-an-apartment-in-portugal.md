If you’re planning to rent an apartment in Portugal without a real estate agent, here’s a step-by-step guide to help you through the process.

1. **Find a suitable option** – Look for listings on platforms like Idealista, or real estate agency websites such as Remax, KW, Porta da Frente, or Century21.
2. **Schedule a viewing** – Contact the landlord or agent to agree on a date and time for the visit.
3. **Visit the apartment** – If you like it, ask for the landlord’s or agent’s email. Let them know you’ll be sending an offer and ask about the general rental conditions. They might reply with something like: “We want €2,000 per month, the contract starts on X date, it’s for three years, and upon signing, we require payment for two months in advance plus two deposits.” Take note of these details and take some time to think.
4. **Prepare your offer** – You can include your own terms, such as negotiating the rent down to €1,900 (if appropriate) or adjusting the contract duration to two or five years, depending on your needs. I have a detailed post on what to include in an offer—check it out here: [11 Tips for Crafting a Strong Rental Offer in Portugal](/lisbon-rental-offer-tips-expats).
5. **Send your offer along with your documents** – Don’t delay! It’s best to send your offer the same day because good apartments get taken quickly.
6. **Wait for the landlord’s response** – If they accept your offer, they’ll send you the contract. If they choose another tenant, they usually won’t notify you. If they do send a rejection, consider that agent a gem! In any case, **don’t stop searching until you have a signed contract**.
7. **Request property documents** – If you’re dealing directly with a private agent or landlord (instead of a well-known agency), ask for:
  - The landlord’s Cartão de Cidadão (Citizen Card)
  - Caderneta Predial (property tax document)
  - Certidão Permanente Predial (property registration certificate)
  - Certificado Energético (energy certificate)
If you’re working with a reputable agency, you can usually skip this step, as they’ve already verified the documents.
8. **Review the documents** – If everything looks good, arrange a date to sign the contract.
9. **Sign the contract** – The tenants usually sign first, followed by the landlords. You’ll then pay the agreed amount and receive the keys. Congratulations!
