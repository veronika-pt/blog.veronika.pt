## When Can You Terminate a Lease?

Portuguese law allows tenants to end a rental contract early, but only after completing at least one-third of the lease term. This rule ensures tenants have some flexibility if their situation changes while protecting landlords from unexpected vacancies. Landlords do not have this right—they must wait until the end of the lease term to terminate the contract.

## Notice Period Rules

Even after completing one-third of the contract, tenants must give written notice before moving out. The law sets maximum notice periods, though the lease agreement may specify a shorter period—but never a longer one:

- Less than 1 year → Up to 90 days’ notice
- 1 year or more → Up to 120 days’ notice

Rent must be paid during this notice period.

### Example: Ending a 3- and 5-Year Lease

For a 3-year contract (36 months):
- The tenant can request termination after 12 months.
- They must then give 120 days' notice before moving out.
- The earliest possible move-out date is 16 months from the lease start.

For a 5-year contract (60 months):
- The tenant can request termination after 20 months (1 year and 8 months).
- They must then give 120 days' notice before moving out.
- The earliest possible move-out date is 24 months (2 years) from the lease start.

## Can You Leave Even Sooner?

If a tenant needs to leave before reaching one-third of the lease term, the only option is negotiation with the landlord. Some landlords may allow an early exit if a replacement tenant is found. However, without an agreement, the minimum stay + notice period must be followed, and rent remains due.
