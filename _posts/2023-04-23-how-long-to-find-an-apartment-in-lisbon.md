When searching for an apartment in Lisbon, it’s important to plan for a timeline of **four to six weeks**. If you have a limited budget and want to find a great apartment in a nice area at a reasonable price, the search might take a little longer.

In a typical situation, I would suggest aiming for **4–6 weeks**. Here's how I would break it down:

- **2–3 weeks**: Start by exploring the options and sending offers to your favorite listings. During this time, you may receive a counteroffer.
- **1 week**: Prepare the contract and go over all the details.
- **1 week**: Sign the contract and make the payment (don’t pay before signing!). Once this is done, you'll get the keys.
- After payment: It usually takes **3–10 days** to transfer utilities to your name.

This timeline is on the optimistic side, but it's possible, especially if you plan ahead. While Lisbon's rental market can feel competitive, especially for expats, don't get discouraged! It's all part of the process. With patience and persistence, you'll find the right place.
