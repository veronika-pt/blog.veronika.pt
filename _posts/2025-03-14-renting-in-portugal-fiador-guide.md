**Who Is a Fiador?**

A fiador in Portuguese rental agreements is a guarantor—someone with Portuguese residency or citizenship who is listed in the lease contract and takes on the responsibility of paying rent if you are unable to do so.

If you’re lucky enough to find such a wonderful person, they will need to provide a _cartão de cidadão_ (citizen card) or _título de residência_ (residence permit) and their _IRS declaration for the previous year_ (IRS — personal tax declaration in Portugal).

If your fiador is married, their spouse must also give consent, meaning both must sign your rental agreement. This also means the spouse will need to provide their _cartão de cidadão and IRS declaration for the previous year_.

The official combined household income of the _fiadores_ (guarantors) must be significantly higher than the rent amount. For example, if you are renting for €2,000 per month, their total family income should be at least €4,000 (the incomes of both spouses are counted together), though €6,000 would be even better.

Having a _fiador_ reassures landlords when renting to new immigrants. As a result, they may agree to more favorable terms for the tenant—for example, requiring only one or two months' rent upfront and a security deposit equal to one month's rent.

Some particularly cautious landlords refuse to accept a _fiador_ who is not a Portuguese citizen. Their concern is that if your _fiador_ only has a residence permit, it might expire before your lease ends. Their anxiety sounds something like: "But what if your _fiador_ doesn’t get their residency renewed?!" In such cases, the only remedy is patient negotiation and providing documents that confirm your _fiador_ has a strong chance of obtaining a residency renewal.
