Hey there! Today, let’s talk about what you can buy at IKEA when you’ve just moved to Portugal, rented an unfurnished apartment, and want to furnish it without breaking the bank.

**Bed** – _Nordli_ with pull-out drawers. It offers three drawers on each side, so you’ll need fewer wardrobes or dressers. If your bedroom is small, a bed with a lift-up mechanism, like _Idanäs_, saves space around it and still provides plenty of storage, though it’s a bit more expensive.

**Clothes Storage Nightstands** – _Besta_. These are deep, so horizontal storage is less convenient, but you can store things vertically or use smaller drawers. You can stack _Besta_ units to make a larger one or place them side by side for low drawers. There's also a tabletop on top to combine them nicely.

**Knives** – From the _Ikea 365_ series, I recommend two separate knives: a small one and a 20 cm one. Add a serrated bread knife to complete your set.

**Flaksa and Skärande** – These tools keep your knives sharp. Get both!

**Råskog** – A rolling storage unit perfect for the kitchen or bathroom, ideal for organizing small items.

**Ikea 365 Containers** – Plastic food storage containers to help keep your fridge neat and organized.

**Sofa** – _Äplaryd_ is a stylish and simple sofa for €850, though its original design costs much more. If you’re on a tighter budget, try _Klippan_ for €249, which is also a cute and basic option.

**Desk** – _Linnmon/Krylle_. _Linnmon_ is a basic but good-sized tabletop (120 × 60 cm, or 3 11" × 1 12"), and _Krylle_ legs on wheels make it more flexible for different spaces. Perfect if you need a desk for work and relaxation.

**Desk Lamp** – _Tertial_. You can buy two for extra brightness. Lightbulbs are not included, so grab those separately.

**Desk Chair** – Opt for one without wheels to avoid scratching the floor and reduce strain on your back due to instability.

**Dining Table** – _Lisabo_, sturdy and easy to assemble, available in both a smaller round and larger rectangular version.

**Tool Set** – _Fixa_ screwdriver set with a hammer and pliers. This is perfect for assembling IKEA furniture, and it’s only €15. Not professional tools, but more than enough for everyday use.

**Storage for Off-Season Clothing** – _Pärkla_. Great for storing clothes when not in season, keeping everything clean and tidy. It fits perfectly in the pull-out drawer of the _Nordli_ bed. You can store things like out-of-season blankets.

**Bedding** – Three types of blankets: Summer, autumn, and winter. The autumn and winter sets come together in the _Småsporre_ set, but sometimes buying separately can be cheaper. In winter, we often use both the autumn and winter blankets together in one duvet cover. This is important in Portugal. For summer, check out _Stjärnstarr_.

![Tillreda Larger Cooktop](/assets/img/tillreda-placa-2.jpg)

**Induction Portable Cooktop** – _Tillreda_ for €49 or €99. It heats up super fast, and it’s a great choice if your apartment doesn’t have an induction stove. Regular ceramic stoves take forever to heat, and gas prices have gone up.

**Microwave** – _Tillreda_. Simple design, easy to use, and not too big.

**Cutting Board** – _Aptitlig_, a bamboo board that won’t warp over time. There are both small and large sizes; it’s ideal to have both.

Later, I’ll share more tips on what to get for your pets, and other furniture and home decor stores in Portugal.
