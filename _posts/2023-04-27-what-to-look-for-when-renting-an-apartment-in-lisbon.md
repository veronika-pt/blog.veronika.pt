When renting an apartment in New York, people usually focus on proximity to subway lines, walking distance to work, vibrancy of the neighborhood, and safety. In Lisbon, however, people also pay attention to factors like airplane flight paths and how low planes fly, which can impact the living experience, especially in certain areas.

For instance, in **Campo de Ourique**, the planes are noticeable but still tolerable. However, in nearby **Campolide**, the noise from the planes is more intense, which is a dealbreaker for many.

Once Iâ€™ve narrowed down the location and price, hereâ€™s what I look for next:

- âœ… **Double-glazed windows** â€“ These are crucial for insulation and keeping the apartment warm in winter, much better than the old cold windows.
- âœ… **Sun exposure** â€“ Ideally, a place with exposure to two sides of the building makes ventilation much easier. If a room faces south, it will be quite hot in summer. For northern rooms it's opposite â€“ it will be quite chilly in winter, and almost no direct sun during the year.
- âœ… **Smart layout** â€“ I always check if the layout makes sense for the way the space will be used.
- âœ… **Storage space** â€“ It's essential to have room for things like suitcases, seasonal bedding, and other storage needs.
- âœ… **Appliances** â€“ I prefer induction stoves (they save time on cooking), and it's also important to check the overall condition of the appliances.
- âœ… **Quality of plumbing** â€“ You don't want to deal with leaks and old plumbing!
- âœ… **Which agency you're working with** â€“ It's important to know which agency is handling the rental for a clearer process.

On the flip side, hereâ€™s what I donâ€™t worry about as much:
- ðŸ«£ Minor imperfections on the walls (stickers, scuffs, stainsâ€”these can be easily fixed and arenâ€™t a dealbreaker).
- ðŸ«£ Unattractive furniture (this can be removed or hidden awayâ€”no big deal).
- ðŸ«£ Squeaky cabinet doors (WD-40 is always a handy fix).
