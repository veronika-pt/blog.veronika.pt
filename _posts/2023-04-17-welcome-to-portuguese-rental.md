Hi everyone! I'm Veronika Troitskaia, a Relocation Project Manager in Lisbon. Iâ€™ve created this blog to share valuable insights about the Portuguese real estate marketâ€”all in one place, instead of answering the same questions individually.

I know that many people struggle to find an apartment in Lisbon, especially if theyâ€™re unfamiliar with the local rental market. And yes, it really can be tricky! The process here is very different from the USA or Russia, with its own rules and nuances. Thatâ€™s why I started this blogâ€”to make renting in Portugal easier for you.

ðŸ’¶ Here, youâ€™ll find practical tips on apartment hunting, settling in after signing a lease, understanding the rental process, and much more.

If you have any questions or need expert advice, donâ€™t hesitate to [reach out](https://www.veronika.pt/consulting)! ðŸ˜Š
