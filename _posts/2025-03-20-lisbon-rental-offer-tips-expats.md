Out of the last 40 rental offers I submitted in Lisbon on behalf of my clients, 19 were accepted. Here are 11 tips to help you create a compelling rental offer:

**1. Subject Line**

Clearly state the apartment's address and your name in the email subject line.

**2. Rental Details**

Specify the desired lease term (typically 1+ years, with 3 years being common), proposed start date, and monthly rent.
If you have strong proof of financial stability, avoid offering a higher price unnecessarily.

**3. Lease Duration Benefits**

A 5-year contract is often more attractive to landlords due to tax benefits (in 2025):

- 3-year lease â†’ 20% tax (instead of the standard 25%)
- 5-year lease â†’ 15% tax
- 10-year lease â†’ 10% tax

Since a 5-year contract offers lower taxes than a 3-year contract, landlords may prefer it.

**4. Advance Payments**

Indicate the number of months you're willing to prepay and the security deposit amount.
While offering extra months upfront can make your offer more attractive, we usually try to avoid this.

**5. Personal Introduction**

Briefly introduce yourself, mentioning your profession and incomeâ€”just the essential details. A personal touch isnâ€™t needed; clarity is better.

**6. Financial Documentation**

Attach documents that demonstrate your financial stability, such as:

- Employment contract
- Recent payslips
- Bank statements


**7. Self-Employment Proof**

If you're self-employed, include relevant documents verifying your income sources, like tax returns or client contracts.

**8. Supporting Documents**

Make sure every claim is backed by supporting documents. Attach copies of:

- Your passport and NIF
- Proofs of income

**9. Guarantors (Fiadores)**

If you have guarantors, provide their income sources and attach supporting documents. More info [on fiadores here](/renting-in-portugal-fiador-guide).

**10. Relevance**

Only include information relevant to your financial stability and ability to pay rent. Avoid unnecessary details.

**11. Keep Trying**

If your offer is rejected, donâ€™t panic. The Lisbon rental market is competitiveâ€”keep searching and sending offers!
